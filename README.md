Update: 26 July 2019
=================================
It seems that I have exhausted most of options trying to get the original account unbanned, it seems unlikely that somebody from Twitter will actually review this.
In the interim I've set up a new bot under [@BXRekt](https://twitter.com/BXRekt).
If the original becomes unbanned, then we'll use the original, if not, then well, such is life.

Update: 25 July 2019
=================================

Twitter has suspended the bot for "impersonation".
This is completely false the bot has never impersonated anyone.

I'm trying hard to get it re-enabled.

See the the [github issue](https://github.com/LittleLightLittleFire/REKT/issues/7) for more information.
