There are no regrets in life, just lessons
They expect one of us the wreckage brother
If I liquidate this position, will you die?
I hurt myself today; to see if I still feel
One does not simply move against the market
When you make an absolutely abhorrent trade
Where will you be when liquidation strikes?
Negotiation's over. Sentence is liquidation.
Only a true warrior can handle 100x leverage
Bitmex liquidation engine is your new God now
You're not going to make it trading like this

Liquidations will continue until morale improves
Everything changed when the fire nation attacked
Give them nothing, but take from them, EVERYTHING
Not even the market manipulators can save you now
The only way to fix this is to use higher leverage
There's nothing more fustrating than starting over
Protip: it really hurts to have to your margin blown
If you can dodge a liquidation you can dodge anything
You want the position? You can't handle the position!
This has been one of the worst trade deals, maybe ever
Are you not entertained? Is this not why you are here?
Learn from other people's mistakes, it's less expensive
In the end... We only regret the chances we didn‚Äôt take
It's like MtGox except it only happened to your account
You exists as we allow it, you will end as we demand it
Confidence born of ignorance, the cycle cannot be broken
Rule #1: Never lose money. Rule #2: Never forget rule #1
Never go against a whale when liquidation is on the line
When the mark price hits the liquidation price just right
All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain
You either die a hero or live long enough to become a meme
Thank you for assuming the party escort submission position
At least you aren't bagholding that losing position anymore
Before us, you are nothing, your liquidation was inevitable
Gentlemen, it has been a privilege trading with you tonight

The money was not lost, it just belongs to someone else now
To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to trade crypto
For what? Liquidate me for what? I thought this was America!
They sent me to liquidation, I sent them to the Shadow Realm
The crime is moving against the market, the sentence is death
Remember when I said I was going to liquidate you last? I lied
Why be alive if you don‚Äôt even try to do something remarkable?
I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
* (The sudden loss of your margin fills you with DETERMINATION.)
You merely adopted to the ocean, I was born in it, moulded by it
If you liked this losing position so much why don't you marry it?
We built this exchange for a certain kind of person, to hurt them
His palms sweaty, knees weak, there's vomit on his sweater already
It's not l-like I w-wanted to get l-liquidated or-r anything! Baka!
It's a shame that this position won't live but then again whose does?
There's no shame in being wrong, only failing to correct our mistakes
On a long enough timeline the survival rate for everyone goes to zero
"Whale" a label created by traders to give voice to their destruction
